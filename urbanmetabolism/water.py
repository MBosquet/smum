    **Water Demand Model**

    This class defines the household water demand model.

    The household demand model is computed as function of:

        - Demographic characteristics of the household.
        - Disposable income of the household.
        - Average water price in the city.
        - Water saving penetration rate (SP) Yuan, X.-C. et al. (2014).
        - Water saving rate (SR) Yuan, X.-C. et al. (2014).

        \\beta_y Y +
        \\beta_p P +
        \\epsilon

    Where:

        - :math:`Q^{hh}_{W,D}` Household water consumption.
        - :math:`HH` Household characteristic.
        - :math:`Y` Household income.
        - :math:`P` Water price.
        - :math:`\\epsilon` Random error term.

    Depending on the water tariff in place the variable :math:`P` can't be
    modeled as an dependent variable. If the water tariff is computes as
    function of consumed volume we cannot assume the error term.

    Household characteristics:

    Efficiency rate:

    The water saving penetration and water saving rate are computed at each
    simulation step. The water saving rate is an indicator for governmental
    actions to reduce water consumption. And the penetration rate is the
    likelihood of household to have adopted the water saving behaviour or
    technology.
