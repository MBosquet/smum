Aim of this Documentation
=========================

This documentation aims to describe the main rationale behind the development
of this python library and to present an overview of the main modules and
functions implemented on the library.

The python library is composed of two main components:

  1. An Urban Metabolism section that aims to balance all resource flows within a
     city system at an aggregated level (i.e. city-level) and;

  2. A Spatial Microsimulation section which constructs a synthetic city and 
     allocates consumption values to micro-level agents.

For a complete implementation example of the Spatial Microsimulation Urban Metabolism Model (SMUM) please refer to the following
`ipython notebook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/emunozh/um/blob/master/docs/example_ph/Welcome.ipynb>`_
